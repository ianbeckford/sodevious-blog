In the past two weeks, I turned nineteen and quit my good grown up job. I’ve always been more mature for my age, and most definitely grew up too fast - by choice. I like the adult that I am, much more than my peer counterparts. Independence and freedom, both in my personal and professional life is so important to me, and I stopped at nothing to make those things come true.

**Take joy in the little things:** Sometimes in the heaviness that life can bring, stopping to smell the roses can set the tone for a day. I’ve found that taking time to appreciate the little things in life makes me gather a larger understanding of what’s going on at the present moment.

**Life is too short to be unhappy:** Don’t get me wrong, it’s never good to give up or quit on something. However, your happiness and sanity should never be sacrificed for a paycheck.

**Listen to advice of others:** Older people are older and wiser for a reason, so listen to what they have to say, even if it doesn’t directly relate to you at the current moment.

**Be careful and organized:** Tax season will come. Be prepared.

**Cover all of your bases:** It’s okay to go out there and make bad decisions, but at the same time make sure all of your needs are met, rent is paid and you have work coming through the door, with savings in the bank.

**You’ll never truly leave high school:** The bullies you knew in school are now all grown up. There seems to be much resemblance to drama from high school in adult life, you just have to avoid it as it’s coming. It’s easy to fall victim to it’s traps, but stay true to who you are! 

**Call your mom many times per month. Please.**
