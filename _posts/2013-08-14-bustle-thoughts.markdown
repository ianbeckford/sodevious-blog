I am a young woman. I believe that women and men are simply equal human beings.

New Yorker Bryan Goldberg [recently launched a publication](http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/13/ive-raised-6-5-million-to-build-and-grow-my-new-company-bustle-com/) called [Bustle.com](http://www.bustle.com/)[^1] that aims to "transform women’s publishing". After taking a look at it, I was left extremely dissapointed. This site wasn't offering me any kind of new perspective, and in fact I was insulted by it's offerings. I'm a woman, so why does that mean that I care about celebrities?

As a lady in the tech industry, I'm insulted that publications like TechCrunch, Mashable, and the Verge are referred to as being "male" focused. Do we really live in a society where we still separate men, women and their interests into stereotypical silos?

> "Maybe we need a destination that is powered by the young women who currently occupy the bottom floors at major publishing houses."

Frankly, paid "young woman" writers are not enough for me to consider this a woman powered publication. At the end of the day, a man does not understand the struggle and prejudices that I face every single day. How can you represent me? How do you know what I want to read?

On another note why does a self proclaimed busy woman care about these headlines?

* HOW DO THE 'BREAKING BAD' ACTORS COMPARE TO THEIR CHARACTERS?

* BEYONCE AND JAY-Z GET BACK TO RUNNING THE WORLD AFTER BARCLAYS CONCERT AND "PICASSO BABY" VIDEO

Should a CEO that is not a parent run a company that create products for babies? Should a CEO that has never turned on a power tool run a home improvement company? Can a business really thrive if it's founder is not it's target demographic? Hey Bryan, you're good at the operations, we get it. But your "publication" is incredibly insulting and serves as nothing more but a reminder that investors should rethink where they're putting their money these days.

Oh really? **Really really?**

#### A Sad Truth

Honestly, this should have been a story of how a woman saw a problem she faced in the publication industry, and sought out to fix it. Instead, this is a story of how a man saw a niche and is exploiting that niche and potential for good money with a "publication", and he's going about it all wrong. This "business" doesn't aim to help women succeed, or move forward, or close the so-called gender gap. It's not making strides to improve our lives; in fact it might just fill a 10 minute coffee break.
