I really enjoy teaching people new things, but when my mom approached me to teach her how to use Illustrator/InDesign/Photoshop, I was a little standoffish. I love her dearly, but I was concerned with:

* her actually retaining the information
* sitting with her and not getting frustrated or into a fight (Parents and children easily annoy each other, as I have observed)
* me being an easy scapegoat for her to not actually learn


Maybe these are selfish concerns, but alas real concerns nonetheless. I think that leading her to water was better than me sitting with her and teaching her. Not only is it a monumental task, but I can see that from what she has taught herself through online tutorials is being retained and used. I’m happy and impressed by this.

She has real desire, and I can see the real results.

Although I’m still around to help, sometimes I feel like I could do more than give bad answers to her questions. A part of me wants her to figure it out, because she’ll be better for it. Another part of me doesn’t want to get into a fight. Just because I know what she want’s to know doesn’t mean I can be a good teacher…

*By the way, I love you ma.*
