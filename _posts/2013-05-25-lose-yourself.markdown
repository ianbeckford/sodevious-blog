Life is nothing but a series of steep rollercoaster-esque valleys and peaks — proverbial, literal or otherwise. That’s the beauty of it. Being vulnerable human beings means that we can have the best and worst moments of our lives in the same week, day, or hour.

So, when the ride slows down, what do you do? Give it some more fuel or let it steep down low?

I think that, to get to the highest peaks, you have to reach the lowest lows. To truly find yourself, you have to lose yourself beyond recognition. To be the person you really want to be, you must first experience the person you know you don’t want to be.

There will eventually be a spark that will be the igniting force behind a rise to the top — but finding that spark can be like the metaphorical needle in a haystack. That search has to begin deep inside of you, and when it’s said and done — you’ve got thicker skin, higher pain tolerance, and a willingness to succeed once more.
