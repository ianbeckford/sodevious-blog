Growing up in my earliest years, my father[^1] would always present decisions to me with: “Do you want it the **easy way or the hard way**?”

Only recently did I connect that part of my life with my inherent necessity to take the harder route in doing the things I do. I’m a firm believer in learning from my mistakes, which usually start with the road less taken, which also happens to be the more difficult way to do something.

I think this fulfills my curiosity. Like, **sure** I could take a cab home from the airport, but *what’s the experience like if I try to get home via public transportation*? This also gives me more independence. If I do something once, and I did it the hard way, then I know I’ll be able to do it on my own if the easy way isn’t available. 

Also, I’ve always had the desire and necessity for a **challenge**. I love problem solving and figuring out how things work - and I think that this is just a natural extension of that.
