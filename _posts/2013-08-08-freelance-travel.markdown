This is something that has been on my mind for a while. I've only ever lived and traveled on the east cost of the United States - and this is something that is bothering me more and more each day. As a person I see freedom and independence as core values, and these two things have shaped my life immensely. But, why is it that I haven't yet let these things help me see the world? 

What's the point of being an independent creative, if my office becomes just a coffee shop in New York? What if I could work while house sitting in California? Or out of a coworking space in Philly? Or on an Amtrak train to Montreal? Honestly, I don't even like working from my home. Sometimes a coworking space can get stale day in and day out. Change helps me focus.  New environments recharge my batteries.

I need to get out of New York. I need to see America. Just one stamp on my passport would be nice.
